# JavaScript History

## It All Started with Netscape Navigator

### In 1995:

- **Netscape Navigator** was the most widely used web browser.
- The developers at Netscape recognized the need for a lightweight programming language to add interactivity to web pages.
- **Brendan Eich**, a developer at Netscape, created the initial version of JavaScript.

#### Evolution of the Name:
- The language was originally named **Mocha**.
- It was later renamed to **LiveScript**.
- Eventually, the name was changed to **JavaScript**, primarily as a marketing strategy to associate with the growing popularity of Java at the time.

> **Note:** Despite the similarity in names, **Java** and **JavaScript** are entirely different programming languages and have no direct relationship in terms of design or functionality.

## The Development of JScript

- Around the same period, **Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE)** was also emerging as a popular web browser.
- To enable similar interactivity in websites, Microsoft introduced its own scripting language called **JScript**.
- JScript was based on JavaScript but included proprietary extensions and modifications specific to Internet Explorer.

## The State of Confusion

### By 1996:

Two competing scripting languages were in use:

- **JavaScript** — developed by Netscape, supported in Netscape Navigator.
- **JScript** — developed by Microsoft, supported in Internet Explorer.

> This situation created confusion among developers, as scripts often behaved differently depending on the browser.
> As a result, many websites began recommending specific browsers to ensure proper functionality and user experience.

## What is ECMA?

- **ECMA** stands for the *European Computer Manufacturers Association*.
- It is a non-profit organization that develops standards for:
  - Computer hardware
  - Communication systems
  - Programming languages

To address inconsistencies between JavaScript and JScript, ECMA standardized JavaScript in 1996.

### ECMAScript

- **ECMAScript** is the standardized specification for the JavaScript programming language.
- The specification is maintained by ECMA and serves as the foundation for all modern JavaScript implementations.

#### Key Versions:
- **ECMAScript 1 (ES1)** — Released in 1997 as the first standardized version.
- **ECMAScript 6 (ES6)** — Released in 2015; considered the most significant update in the language’s history.
- **ECMAScript 13 (ES13)** — Released in 2022; the 13th edition of the standard.

## ECMA-262

- **ECMA-262** is the official documentation that defines the ECMAScript specification.
- It outlines:
  - The syntax rules of the language
  - The semantics and behavior of the core JavaScript API
  - Guidelines for implementation in web browsers and other environments

For more details, refer to the official document: [ECMA-262](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)

## TC39 – The JavaScript Standards Committee

- **TC39** is the technical committee responsible for the evolution of the ECMAScript language.
- The committee is composed of:
  - JavaScript engine developers
  - Industry experts
  - Academics
  - Contributors from the open-source community

- The committee meets every two months to discuss, propose, and review new features for the language.
- ECMAScript is updated annually, based on the consensus and proposals accepted by TC39.
